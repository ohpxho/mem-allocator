# Memory Allocator

This project is my implementation of a memory allocator in C. Building this as part of learning systems programming concepts—how memory allocation works, virtual memory, and the interaction between programs and the OS.

### Notes

### Process

1. When a program starts, the OS will give it a small inital heap (around kb of size).
